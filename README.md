<i>One observation has always struck me profoundly: when we pause to truly observeâ€”be it the universe, our own hearts, or a childâ€”it may appear static. Such stillness is captivating. Yet, beneath this apparent calm, there exists an undercurrent of movement and transformation. Everything is in a perpetual state of flux, leaning towards a potential future or rooted in an unchangeable past. This intrinsic motion, whether for better or worse, remains largely unseen. It serves as a reminder that while we are shaped by our past, we are also perpetually stepping into the future.</i>
